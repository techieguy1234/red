## Project Description
This project is a Node.js Express application that acts as a contact database. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete individual contacts. The application does not use a database to store persistent data, instead, it persists the data using a file on the file system.

## Development Environment
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Node.js Version: 6.9.0
- Code Editor: VS Code

## Insights and Results
I worked on a Node.js Express application for the lab assignment. The application acts as a contact database, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete individual contacts. The data is persisted using a file on the file system.
I provided a basic structure for my application, including how to set up the routes and how to read and write the contacts data from and to the JSON file.
I also created the Pug templates for my application, including the layout, home page, contacts list, single contact view, and new and edit contact forms.
I encountered a few issues along the way, such as getting the raw JSON data instead of the rendered view, an error with setting the view engine, and a conflict with the routes. But I fixed these issues.
